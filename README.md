# Futures-Bot-Back-Tester
Lets you test your strategy for Futures contracts.


One problem I have with many of the backtesting libs in Python is that they really only work for spot trading. I wanted to make a futures testing bot so that anyone can test their strategy for both Longs (profit when price goes up) and Shorts (profit when price goes down).

Things to work on
-Everything, this is a work in progress. I made a backtesting software specifically for a strategy I made and so I need to make it so everyone and anyone could input their strategy to test it out.
