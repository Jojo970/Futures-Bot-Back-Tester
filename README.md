# Futures-Bot-Back-Tester
Lets you test your strategy for Futures contracts.


One problem I have with many of the backtesting libs in Python is that they really only work for spot trading. I wanted to make a futures testing bot so that anyone can test their strategy for both Longs (profit when price goes up) and Shorts (profit when price goes down).

The code provided will show an example of how I used multiple for loops to run through a CSV file and compute my expected profits based on the strategy I implemented.

The original strategy is removed but the logic, I believe, will be helpful.
